## MLR Review Process

### What is MLR?

MLR (Medical, Legal, Regulatory) review is the structured process of reviewing promotional content through three essential lenses to ensure compliance before distribution.

### The Three Reviews

| Review | Focus | Reviewers |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Medical** | Clinical claims validity, scientific accuracy, benefit-risk balance | Medical directors, physicians |
| **Legal** | Advertising compliance, litigation risk, IP protection | Legal counsel |
| **Regulatory** | FDA/EMA alignment, label compliance, required disclosures | Regulatory affairs |

### Review Goals

- Claims supported by valid scientific data
- Benefits not overstated
- Safety information clearly communicated
- Compliant with health authority guidelines
- Proper disclaimers and disclosures included

### Typical MLR Workflow

```
Content Creation → Medical Review → Legal Review → Regulatory Review
        ↓                ↓               ↓                ↓
    Draft Created    Approved/       Approved/        Approved/
                    Changes Req     Changes Req      Changes Req
                         ↓               ↓                ↓
                    Revisions → Re-review → Re-review → Final Approval
                                                            ↓
                                                      Distribution
```
