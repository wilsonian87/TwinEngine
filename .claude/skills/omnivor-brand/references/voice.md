# OmniVor Voice & Tone

| **Relentless** | Never stops processing signal. Thoroughness is a virtue. | "847 signals processed." |
| **Direct** | Short sentences. No fluff. Every word works. | "3 patterns require attention." |
| **Transformational** | Raw becomes refined. Chaos becomes clarity. | "Raw signals in. Refined insight out." |
| **Knowing** | Slightly ahead—already sees what you're about to ask. | "OMNIVOR spotted this pattern 3 weeks ago." |
