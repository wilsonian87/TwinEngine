# Competitive Assessment Task

## Purpose
Evaluate competitive pressure on HCPs and recommend defensive strategies.

## Input Requirements
- Target HCPs or cohort
- Competitors to analyze (or all)
- Time period for trend analysis

## Assessment Framework

### 1. Competitive Landscape
- Active competitors in territory
- Market share distribution
- Competitor engagement activity levels

### 2. CPI Analysis
- CPI distribution across target HCPs
- Trend direction (increasing/stable/decreasing)
- Risk level breakdown (low/medium/high/critical)

### 3. Threat Identification
- HCPs with CPI > 75 (critical)
- HCPs with rapidly increasing CPI
- Engagement asymmetry (competitor more active)

### 4. Opportunity Detection
- Competitors losing momentum (decreasing CPI)
- Share erosion opportunities
- Weakly defended HCPs

### 5. Defensive Recommendations
- Immediate intervention targets
- Proactive engagement list
- Channel strategy adjustments

## Output Format

## Competitive Assessment: [Territory/Cohort]

### Threat Level Summary
| Level | HCP Count | % of Territory |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Critical | X | XX% |
| High | X | XX% |
| Medium | X | XX% |
| Low | X | XX% |

### Top Competitive Threats
1. **[Competitor A]**: Avg CPI XX, affecting X HCPs
   - Key tactic: [observed behavior]
   - Counter-strategy: [recommendation]

2. **[Competitor B]**: Avg CPI XX, affecting X HCPs
   - Key tactic: [observed behavior]
   - Counter-strategy: [recommendation]

### Immediate Action Required
| HCP | Current CPI | Trend | Recommended Action |
|-----|-------------|-------|-------------------|
| Dr. X | 85 | ↑ | Defensive outreach |

### Opportunities
- [X] HCPs where competitor is weakening

## Guardrails
- Base recommendations on data, not assumptions
- Flag low-confidence assessments
- Do not make claims about competitor products without data
