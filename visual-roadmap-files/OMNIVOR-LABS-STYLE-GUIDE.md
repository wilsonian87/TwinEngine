## Brand Essence

### Who We Are

OMNIVOR LABS is the strategic intelligence platform that transforms complexity into clarity. We consume every signal across every channel—structured data, unstructured roughage, fragmented touchpoints—and metabolize it into refined, actionable insight.

### Brand Positioning

> For pharmaceutical brand teams drowning in fragmented engagement data, OMNIVOR LABS is the strategic intelligence platform that consumes complexity across every channel and touchpoint—transforming overwhelming data ecosystems into precise, actionable insight.

### Core Metaphor

**Consumption → Transformation → Intelligence**

Like fire transformed raw calories into brain development for early humans, OMNIVOR LABS transforms raw data into evolved insight. We don't just analyze—we metabolize.

## Voice & Tone

### Brand Voice Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Confident** | States facts without hedging | "Here's what's happening." not "It seems like..." |
| **Direct** | Short sentences, no fluff | "3 patterns require attention." |
| **Transformational** | Emphasizes input → output | "Raw signals in. Refined insight out." |
| **Knowing** | Slightly ahead, already sees | "OMNIVOR spotted this pattern 3 weeks ago." |

### Voice Do's

- Use active voice
- Lead with insight, not process
- Be specific with numbers and outcomes
- Speak to marketers, not data scientists

### Voice Don'ts

- Never apologetic or uncertain
- Never use "please" or "sorry" in UI copy
- Never explain the metaphor literally ("like an omnivore eating...")
- Never use jargon without immediate value

### Sample Copy

**Dashboard Welcome:**
> OMNIVOR has processed 847 signals since your last session. Three patterns have crystallized.

**Empty State:**
> No data yet. Connect your channels and let OMNIVOR feed.

**Insight Delivery:**
> Your Southeast oncologists are going dark on email. OMNIVOR spotted the pattern. Here's the play.

**Error State:**
> Connection interrupted. Reconnecting now.

**Feature Description:**
