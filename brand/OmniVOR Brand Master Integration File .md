# OmniVOR Brand Master Integration File (v4.0)
**Theme:** Engineering Excellence & Strategic Momentum
**Core Equation:** Massive Intelligence × Strategic Velocity = Momentous Impact

---

## 1. Core Brand Wordmark: The VOR Framework
The legacy "Visualization, Orchestration, Reporting" is officially deprecated. All platform documentation, tooltips, and headers must reflect the kinetic "VOR" model:

- **V: VELOCITY**
  - **Meaning:** Speed with direction. The rate at which the engine converts raw data mass into a strategic trajectory.
  - **Context:** Used for Command Palette (⌘K), real-time ingestion, and navigation speed.
- **O: OPTIMIZATION**
  - **Meaning:** The intelligence filter. Balancing the Competitive Pressure Index (CPI) and Message Saturation Index (MSI).
  - **Context:** Used for Simulation Studio and Scenario Comparisons.
- **R: READINESS**
  - **Meaning:** The "Last Mile" state. Moving from observation to being "Cleared for Deployment."
  - **Context:** Used for the Action Queue, Veeva/Marketo sync, and deployment status.

## 2. Visual Identity & Logo Guidelines
The platform aesthetic is "High-Performance Automotive," justifying premium pricing and high-touch support.

- **The Icon (The Performance Badge):** - A minimalist gold silhouette of a Kodiak Bear jaw. 
  - **Style:** Architectural Minimalism. Single-weight lines.
  - **Constraint:** No mechanical parts, no fur textures, no "mascot" eyes. It must look like a luxury car emblem.
- **Typography:** - Clean, wide-tracked geometric sans-serif. 
  - The "V" in OmniVOR is the hero: sharp left stem, aerodynamic curved right stem. No overlapping textures or lines through the font.
- **UI Materiality:** - **Background:** "Deep Space Purple" with abstract light trails (night-track motion). 
  - **Modules:** High-radius "Bubble" corners (24px) with Glassmorphism (15% opacity, high blur).
  - **Accent:** "Catalyst Gold" used exclusively for high-value metrics and primary action triggers.

## 3. The "Momentum" Narrative
The landing page and executive summaries must follow this specific copy hierarchy to move away from "IT/Tech" jargon toward "Strategic Impact."

### Headline:
**Massive Intelligence. Strategic Velocity. Momentous Impact.**

### Subheadline:
*Digest your data faster; command precision-guided optimizations at the speed of insight.*

### Narrative Pillars:
- **Digest (The Omnivore):** Replacing "Ingest." It implies the platform consumes, breaks down, and utilizes the data mass.
- **Precision-Guided:** Reinforces the "Digital Twin" accuracy and low-risk transformational gains.
- **Momentous Impact:** A dual-meaning nod to the physics of momentum and the "Moments that Matter" in the HCP journey.

## 4. UI Copy & String Updates
Update `client/src/lib/brand-copy.ts` and all documentation with the following mapping:

| Legacy Term | New Integration Term | Tone/Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Reporting / Dashboard | **Readiness Hub** | Action-oriented |
| Analyze / View | **Accelerate / Deploy** | Kinetic |
| Engage Thrusters | **Login / Enter Platform** | Professional / Premium |
| Help / FAQ | **Strategic Concierge** | High-touch / Exclusive |
| Pending | **Optimized** | High-confidence |
| Action Queue | **Readiness Queue** | Launch-ready |
| Results | **Impact** | Strategic weight |

## 5. Development & UX Physics
- **Entrance Sequence:** Post-login, use a 2-second "Initialization Overlay" featuring the text: `INITIALIZING STRATEGIC VELOCITY ENGINE... READY FOR MOMENTOUS IMPACT.`
- **Animation Curves:** Use `cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)` for all transitions to mimic the deceleration of a performance vehicle.
- **Premium Friction:** Every primary action (Deployment) should have a subtle "Catalyst Gold" glow to increase perceived value.

---

## 6. Business Model Alignment
- **Aspirational Positioning:** We build for the "Cockpit" of the brand lead. 
- **The "V" Signature:** Every module should have a "V-Rating" (Velocity Rating) indicating the freshness and strategic readiness of the underlying data.
- **Support:** "Mission Support" is not a ticket system; it is a direct line to a dedicated account strategist.
